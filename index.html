               <p>I’m originally  from Puerto Rico, mainly raised in South, Florida. Growing up I had the opportunity to live in both countries. I'm grateful to have learned both English and Spanish from a very young age and experience two different cultures.</p>
               <p>Towards the end of the summer in 2009 I enlisted In the U.S. Army where I served two enlistments totaling in 6 years. During that time I was fortunate enough to have traveled to a number of places. I also learned life skills that I will value for years to come.</p>
               <p>After the military I relocated to atlanta to pursue an education. I started in business but then realized that it was not something a was passionate about. I later on discovered that I really enjoyed being creative and liked the idea of learning something that would keep me on my toes. 
                  After digging into different fields I made a match with web development. I’m currently a student web developer with interest in front end work but definitely wanting to dabble with anything and everything!</p>
