            <p class="main">
            I was born in the city of manati, Puerto Rico. I grew up in South, Florida.
            Growing up I was able to live in in both Puerto Rico and Florida. I was furnate to learn
            both english and spanish from very young. My mother worked as a stay at home mom and my
            father worked in auto body repair. My parents have been big examples to me and my siblings.
            I'm the second to last of my 4 other siblings. We all have taken completely diffrent carrer
            paths. When I gratuated high school, i joined the military. That summer after graduation 
            I left for basic training for the U.S. Army. I lived GA while I completed all of my required</p><p>
            training. I then was sent to my first unit in Tacoma washington. I was Assigined to Joint Base Lewis-McChord.
            I spent 3 and a half of my 6 years of service there. I also did a 12 month tour to Afghanistan while serving
            at Joint Base Lewis-McChord. After I was promoted to Sergeant I relinsted and relocated back to Georgia
            to the city of Savannah. I was assiginged to Hunter Army Airfield. There I worked for Garrison Headquarts, 
            which is a unit that manages the installation. I was the Vice President for a Program that worked with single Soldiers.
            I voiced options, I created eductional/socail events. I also worked along side to the base 
            Commander. While in savannah i started to work a second job as a server later progrssing into bartednding.
            I decied that I wanted to wrap up my carrer in the military and start a carrer in business.
            I was accepted to Kenessaw Sate University in Atlanta, Georgia. I started for a year and realized that
            I wasnt ready so ithought and took an extened break. I worked in the restuarant indistie for a few years. I started wondering where my 
            life was headed and if i wanted to finish school. I honestly thought that it would be hard to get back into school 
            and start over. I then started to educate myself on diffrent carrers and ran itno web development. 
            with a little reserch i noticed that invery entertained.
